I'm Mehedi , just a regular guy who once tapped away at a keyboard as a developer but now finds himself engulfed in the thrilling world of entrepreneurship. But enough about me; let's dive into what this blog is all about.\n\nYou see, life as a serial entrepreneur is like navigating uncharted waters ‚Äì filled with unexpected discoveries, storms, and breathtaking sunsets. I wanted to create a space where I can share my experiences with you as I journey through the realms of marketing, business life, meditation, and growth hacking. Trust me, it's quite the adventure!\n\nNow, I don't want you to think I'm some sort of guru you should follow blindly. Far from it! I'm just a young entrepreneur learning the ropes and enjoying the challenges that come with building ventures like [Themefisher](https://themefisher.com \"Themefisher\"), [Gethugothemes](https://gethugothemes.com \"Gethugothemes\"), and [Statichunt](https://Statichunt.com \"Statichunt\"). I thought it'd be fun to document my journey and share it with you, hoping that you might find a nugget of wisdom, a chuckle, or even inspiration along the way.\n\nSo, what can you expect from this blog? Well, think of it as a travelogue of a young entrepreneur's odyssey. Here, you'll find stories about:\n\n1. Navigating the ever-evolving world of marketing, with its twists, turns, and hidden treasures.\n2. Chronicles of my entrepreneurial escapades, including the victories, the setbacks, and the lessons learned.\n3. Glimpses into the day-to-day life of running a business, the challenges, and the joys.\n4. Meditation and mindfulness adventures to help maintain balance and focus amidst the chaos of entrepreneurship.\n5. Hacking our way through growth, discovering tricks and strategies to scale businesses faster and more efficiently.\n\nSo, grab a cup of coffee (or tea, if that's your thing), and join me on this wild ride. I hope my stories can provide you with some entertainment, maybe even a few lessons learned, but most importantly, a sense of camaraderie as we navigate the exhilarating world of entrepreneurship together.\n\nOnce again, welcome to blog, and happy reading!\n\n## Tech behind my website\n\nThis website runs on Next.js, which I've used as a static site generator .The CMS part, I've got Forestry handling things (as long as they keep offering support , as they are closing soon ). Site hosted on Vercel (my absolute favorite), and Cloudflare's got my back with a secure and speedy DNS service. üòäüåê\n";

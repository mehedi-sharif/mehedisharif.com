I’m thrilled to introduce my new website—a personal space where I’ll document my thoughts, experiences, and insights. Over the past 12 years, I’ve ventured into entrepreneurship, embraced mindfulness practices, and dived into books and courses that have shaped my journey.

Along the way, I’ve built and grown several ventures, including [Themefisher.com](http://themefisher.com), a marketplace for high-quality website themes; [GetHugoThemes.com](http://gethugothemes.com), a platform dedicated to Hugo-based themes; [StaticHunt](https://statichunt.com "Google"), a directory of free static themes; and [UIHut.com](http://uihut.com), 26k resources for UI/UX design assets. Each of these projects has taught me invaluable lessons that I’ll be sharing here.

One of the main reasons I started this blog is to test and experience the CMS I’m building.I want to ensure that my CMS is practical, user-friendly, and reliable in real-life scenarios. What better way to do that than by making this site my playground?

### Tech behind my website

This blog is powered by a simple yet efficient tech stack. \
[Astro]() as the static site generator (my absolute favorite) , 

[Github]() version control, \
[Netlify]() to handle hosting and make deployments seamless ,\
[Cloudflare]() secure and speedy DNS service To manage everything, \
CMS: I’m using my own Git-based CMS—a tool (I will release that very soon ....)

It’s a straightforward setup, but it’s exactly what I need to keep things lightweight, fast, and easy to manage!\

Another interesting fact: with a size of just 300KB, my website proudly qualifies as a member of the [512KB Club](https://512kb.club).
